# Cloud Providers Quick Guide

Quick reference for connecting cloud AI providers.

## What Are Cloud Providers?

Cloud providers let you use AI models hosted on remote servers when local inference isn't suitable (e.g., very large models, specialized capabilities). AndroLLM supports any provider compatible with the **LiteLLM proxy protocol** (OpenAI-compatible API).

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Base URL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | `https://api.openai.com` | GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo |
| Anthropic | Via LiteLLM proxy | Claude 3 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku |
| Google Gemini | Via LiteLLM proxy | Gemini 1.5 Pro, Flash |
| xAI Grok | `https://api.x.ai` | Grok-2 |
| Mistral | `https://api.mistral.ai` | Mistral Large, Small |
| Self-hosted LiteLLM | Your URL | Any model through your proxy |

## Adding a Provider

1. Go to **Settings → Cloud Providers**
2. Tap **Add Provider**
3. Enter:
   - **Name**: Display name (e.g., "OpenAI")
   - **Base URL**: API endpoint (e.g., `https://api.openai.com`)
   - **API Key**: Your secret key (encrypted locally)
4. Tap **Save**
5. The app will discover available models automatically

## Using Cloud Models

1. In the chat screen, tap the model selector
2. Choose a cloud model from your configured providers
3. Chat normally — responses stream in real-time

---

## Security

- API keys are encrypted with **AES-256/GCM** via Android Keystore
- Keys are decrypted only at request time — never logged
- You control which provider is active at any time
- Disable cloud mode entirely in Settings

---

## Provider Health

The app monitors provider health automatically:
- Periodic probes to `/health/liveliness`
- Latency tracking per provider
- Automatic failover to healthy providers
- Status shown in Cloud Providers screen

---

## Custom Providers

You can add any LiteLLM-compatible endpoint:

```
Name: My Company
Base URL: https://litellm.internal.example.com
API Key: sk-...
```

Custom models can be specified per-model with alternate keys or headers.
