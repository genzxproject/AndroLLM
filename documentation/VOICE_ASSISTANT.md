## How It Works

```
"Hey Andro" → Wake word detected → "Yes?" → [you speak]
                                              ↓
                                    Speech recognized
                                              ↓
                                    Sent to LLM (local or cloud)
                                              ↓
                                    Response spoken aloud
```

**All processing is offline.** No audio leaves your device.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Wake word not detected | Speak closer, reduce background noise, increase sensitivity |
| No response after wake word | Check mic permission; try "Okay Andro" variant |
| TTS not speaking | Check media volume; wait for model load (~3 sec first time) |
| Service stops unexpectedly | Disable battery optimization for AndroLLM in Android settings |
| Barge-in doesn't work | Ensure VAD threshold is appropriate; speak clearly during playback |
